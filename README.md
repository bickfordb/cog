# cog

A Leiningen plugin to do watch targets and execute shell build commands on change.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[cog "1.0.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
cog 1.0.0`.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[cog "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein cog
